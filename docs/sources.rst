CPIA 246
--------

Procedures recommended by the JANNAF Performance Standardization Working Group for acquisition and Interpretation 
of performance test data are presented. Included with the description of these procedures are recommended procedures 
covering the required measurements, associated instrumentation, calibration methods, and data uncertainties. 

In addition, criteria for the applicability of existing test data, the selection of test models, and analytical 
performance prediction improvement based on test results are outlined.

The Defense Technical Information Center describes it at the following link,
`CPIA Publication 246, JANNAF Rocket Engine Performance Prediction and Evaluation Manual <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA127654>`_.
Although approved for public release, at the time of this writing, CPIA 246 is not available as a PDF from
the Defense Technical Information Center.

It is possible to find a PDF, however, with a 
`Google Search for CPIA 246 <https://www.google.com/search?q=pdf+JANNAF+Rocket+Engine+Performance+Prediction+Evaluation+Manual>`_.

From the component design to the subsystem design to the engine systems design, 
engine development, and flight-vehicle application, this how-to text bridges 
the gap between basic physical and design principles and actual rocket-engine design as 
it's done in industry.

`Rocket Propulsion Elements <https://archive.org/details/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements_8th_Edition_by_Oscar_Biblarz_George_P._Sutton>`_

For sixty years, Sutton's Rocket Propulsion Elements has been regarded as the 
single most authoritative source book on rocket propulsion technology. 
As with the previous edition, coauthored with Oscar Biblarz, the 
Eighth Edition of Rocket Propulsion Elements offers a thorough introduction to 
basic principles of rocket propulsion for guided missiles, space flight, or satellite flight. 
It describes the physical mechanisms and designs for various types of rockets' 
and provides an understanding of how rocket propulsion is applied to flying vehicles
